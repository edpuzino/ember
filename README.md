![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) JS Framework Comparative Analysis
=======================================================================

## Framework Name (Ember)

### Research Conducted By: Ashley Bruenich, Michael Kermes, James McDaniel, Ed Puzino

### Overall Score and Comments
#### Score (Out of 10): 7
#### General Comments
* Called: “The best JavaScript framework in 2015”
* It combines the best features of its predecessors and competitors, like Angular and React.
* Front-end framework that creates one-page web apps and complex multi-page apps. 
* As a developer, you write dramatically less code with integrated templates that update automatically when the data changes. 
* Uses Routes - Think of these as different pages
* Generators - Automate boilerplate code for common tasks
* Ember Inspector - A browser extension to inspect your application. 


#### Pros
* Faster Development due to Ember CLI
* VERY thorough documentation (goes into basics of JS)
* Own debugging tool (Ember Inspector)
* Writes tests for you
* Lots of extensions


#### Cons
* Difficult to learn 
* Too big for small projects
* Smaller community 
* Extensive amount of outdated tutorials on the web 
* Slowly release new version with few new options


### Ratings and Reviews
#### Documentation
* The learning curve with Ember is significantly higher than Gatsby.js.
* It doesn’t accept React off the bat. There are a lot of customizations you need to make to the settings in order for it to accept JSX. 
* State works differently than React so that is a bit difficult to wrap your head around. 
* But once you understand the framework, it seems that it would make building out apps with repetitive structures very easy.


#### Systems Requirements
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with npm)
* [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/)
* [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome/)


#### Ramp-Up Projections
It should take a few days to a week for a small dev team to get some things working.
And about a month to get down most of the functionality.


#### Community Support and Adoption levels
Ember seems to have peeked in around 2013 or 2014 and has seen a steady decline since then as meteor and then vue started to gain popularity.
